## Questions

### How long did it take you to complete this assignment?

I had a working example, that would resize to keep images within max bounds, at 1hr 50min.

I was having fun, so I added "percentage-resize" tracking to the images, to keep them in the same place relative to max bounds, on window resize. Done at 2hr 20min.

At this point, I felt I'd demonstrated my ability to jump in, learn, and get things done. However, the code was "sandbox" level. It was great for proof of concept, but not "scalable". Decided to clean up code and make it more "real-world" level. Stopped at 3hr 10min.

### What about this assignment did you find most challenging?

Surprisingly, not using Canvas API. I don't like coding under "time limits", so for me the hardest part was balancing time vs polishing the final product. I always want to do the "absolute best" at everything I do. In terms of coding, I knew exactly what to do, but in terms of the test, I wasn't sure if it was "extra-mile", and if increasing my total time on project to 4 hours would be better or worse for the purposes of evaluation.

### What about this assignment did you find unclear?

At first I felt confident that it would be perfectly acceptable to build out the shell code given, but after finishing and reading these questions, I started to wonder if I was expected to spin up a Vue app or something.

### What challenges did you face that you did not expect?

I hadn't used Canvas API much, so I was afraid I would come up against some big problems, but it was actually pretty easy. Things like mouse-tracking, and state management are second nature at this point, so it basically came together exactly as I expected.

### Do you feel like this assignment has an appropriate level of difficulty?

Yes. It was just the right level to feel like I'd done something without being overwhelming.

### Briefly explain your decisions to use tools, frameworks and libraries like React, Vue, etc.

I didn't use any tools, libraries, or frameworks.

I got the idea from the write-up that they wanted to see me work with low-level browser technologies, to demonstrate coding knowledge, and not hide behind libraries that would do the thinking for me.

Obviously in the real world, I would have.
